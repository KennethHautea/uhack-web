        Since 2009, Nick Automatic has been creating ambiguous and brazen lifestyle shirts with dreams dominating the world.<br><br>
        What started as a grassroots operation of one, is now ran by a twenty man crew known as Team Automatic. At the center of it all is Nicolo Nimor, the brand’s lead designer, who was named as one of the 20 Best Young Designers by BluPrint Magazine. Nimor, aside from starting Nick Automatic, has worked with big names and brands such as Nicki Minaj, David Hasselhoff, Electric Zombie, Artwork, Team Manila, Samsung, Tattoo,  and Ford. Nick Automatic draws inspiration from people, culture, and the different scenes that they indulge in ; from the the underground to the colloquial, to the streets and the music scene.<br><br>
        Nick Automatic greatly embodies the spirit of pop-punk and post-hardcore rock. The brand has catapulted itself into the spotlight by enlisting artists such as New Found Glory, A Day To Remember, Mayday Parade, Forever the Sickest Kids, Miss May I, Silverstein, Arcadia, Chicosci, Jejaview, Urbandub, and many others to rep the brand on and off stage.<br><br>
        The brand’s vision of hand-made worldwide domination is slowly coming to fruition, one shirt at a time.
